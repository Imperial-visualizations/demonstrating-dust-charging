                    OML theory from Shukla:
                    we cosider that from and infinite distance a plasma particle j i sapproching a spherical dust grainn of radius $r_d$ and charge $q_d$. When the plasma particle enters the debye sphere it feels the influence of dust grain and its path changes due to the electrostatic force. We asssume that $v_j$ and $v_{gj}$ are the speed of the of the plasma particle before and after its grazing collision with the dust grain. it is obvious for a fixed velocity, as we decrease the impact paratmater $b_j$, the plasma particle hits the dust grain. The cross section for charging collisions between the dust and the plasma particle $j$ is $\sigma^d_j = \pi b^2_j$.

                    Conservation of momentum and energy requires that 
                    $$
                        m_jv_jb_j = m_jv_{gj}r_d
                    $$
                    and 
                    $$
                        \frac{1}{2}m_jv^2_j = \frac{1}{2}m_jv^2_{gj} + \frac{q_jq_d}{r_d}
                    $$
                    The dust grain charge $q_d$ is related tp the potential difference $\phi_d(= \phi_g - \phi_p)$ between the grain potential $\phi_g$ adn the plasma potenital $\phi_p$ i.e $q_d = C\phi_d$, where capacitance C of the spherical dust grain in a plasma is $C = r_dexp(-r_d/\lambda_d)\simeq r_d$ for $\lambda_d >> r_d$. Using the relation $q_d = r_d\phi_d$ and conservatin of momentum and energy equations one can express $b_j$ in terms of $\phi_d$. Thus $\sigma^d_j$ becomes 
                    $$\label{eq:sig}
                        \sigma^d_j = \pi r^2_d(1-\frac{2q_j\phi_d}{m_jv^2_j})
                    $$
                    If $f_j(v_j)$ is the velocity distribution of the plasma species at infinite distances from the dust grain, the dust grain current $I_j$ carried by the plasma species $j$ is 
                    $$\label{eq:I}
                        I_j = q_j\int_{V^{min}_j}^{\inf}v_j\sigma^d_jf_j(v_j)d\textbf{v}_j
                    $$
                    where $V^{min}_j$ is the minimum value of the plasma particle velocity for which the particle hits the dust grain. To approximate $V^{min}_j$ we consider two situations, namely $q_j\phi_d < 0$ and $q_j\phi_d > 0$. When $q_j\phi_d < 0$, the plasma particle and dust grain attract each other and the integration equation is to be preformed over the complete $v_j$ domain. On the other hand, when $q_j\phi_d > 0$, the plasma particle and the dust grain repel each other and hence $V^{min}_j > 0$ in order to allow for a collision between the dust grain and the plasma particle. Thus in this case $V^{min}_j$ becomes
                    $$
                        V^{min}_j = (-\frac{2q_j\phi_d}{m_j})^{-0.5}
                    $$
                    we further assume that the velocity distribution of the plasma species is Maxwellian, i.e
                    $$\label{eq:f}
                        f_j(v_j) = n_j(\frac{m_j}{2\phi k_B T_j})^{3/2}exp(-\frac{m_jv_j^2}{2k_BT_j})
                    $$
                    where $n_j$ is the plasma particle number density. Substituting equation \ref{eq:sig} and \ref{eq:f} into \ref{eq:I}, expressing the result in spherical polar coordinates and preforming integration we can write the charging current $I_j$ for attractive($q_j\phi_d < 0$) potenials as 
                    $$
                        I_j = 4\pi r^2_d n_j q_j (\frac{k_BT_j}{2\pi m_j})^{1/2}(1 - \frac{q_j\phi_d}{k_B T_j})
                    $$
                    repulsive($q_j\phi_d > 0$) potentials as 
                    $$\label{eq:2.2.7}
                        I_j = 4\pi r^2_d n_j q_j (\frac{k_BT_j}{2\pi m_j})^{1/2}exp(-\frac{q_j\phi_d}{k_B T_j})
                    $$
                    equation \ref{eq:2.2.7} is valid for any repulsive potential in a maxwellian plasma as long as the surface potential mas a monotonic behaviour outwards from the surface as well as when the streaming speed $v_{j0}$ is much smaller than the thermal speed $V_{Tj}$.

                    \section{Lambert W Function}
                    the lameber W fnction W(z) is defined as the inverse function fo $f(x) = xexp(x)$ for any complex number Z so that its defining proerty is 
                    $$
                        Z = W(Z)exp(W(Z))
                    $$
                    by multiplying equation 2.45(FROM BRAY) by $exp(-\theta)$ and rearranging we see that the OML floating condition can be thought of as being of the form $\Gamma exp(\gamma) = \kappa(\mu,\phi)$. The solution of this expression may be written as $\Gamma = W(\kappa(\mu, \theta))$. Subsequently, it is found that equation 2.48 has an analytic solution which can be written as 
                    $$
                        (\theta + \Phi^f_d)exp(\theta + \Phi^f_d) = \sqrt{\mu \theta}exp(\theta)
                    $$
                    $$
                        \Phi^f_d = W[\sqrt{\mu \theta}exp(\theta)] - \theta
                    $$
