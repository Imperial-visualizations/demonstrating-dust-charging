                    <h3>DRAFT/COPIED - Modified Orbital Limited Motion - MOML</h3>

                    In the limit of a large grain assumption that only grains??? with a parameter less than the $\eta_c$ are collected breaks down due to presence of sheath. Bohm’s postulate, that ions entering the sheath must be travelling at the Bohm speed (the sound speed) $c^2_s= \frac{K_b(\gamma T_i+T_e)}{m_i}$ where $\gamma$ is the ratio of the specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume respectively, implies the presence of potential barriers which are functions of ion energy. Assume that all potential barriers exist at or within the sheath thereby making the sheath edge the effective grain radius.  The MOML floating condition is derived by applying OML at the sheath edge. Assuming a negatively charged grain,  the electrons will be unaffected by the potential barriers due to the sheath since it is a region positive charge density shielding the negatively charged grain in this instance. Following Willis et. al and assuming that all ions which enter the absorption radius are collected at the grain surface the ion current. This gives ion current as 
                    $$
                        I_i = \pi a^2n_0 e (\frac{8k_bT_i}{\pi m_i})^{-0.5}[1 - \frac{e}{k_bT_i}(\phi_s)]
                    $$
                    substituting $\phi_d - \Delta\phi = \phi_s$ and equating with the electron current (BRAY 2.44) and normalising the floating condition is obtained
                    $$
                        exp(-\Phi^f_d) = \sqrt{\frac{\theta}{\mu}}(1 + \frac{\Phi^f_d}{\theta} - \frac{\Delta \Phi}{\Phi})
                    $$
                    In the thin sheath limit, the situation is equivalent to the planar wall in section 2.1.1 so that, with the assumption that all ions enter the sheath are collected by the grain, it is possible to estimate the potential drop across the sheath.   The ion flux at the sheath edge,$Γ^i_{se} = n^i_{se}c_s$, is assumed to be equal the electron flux at the sheath edge,$Γ^e_{se} = n^e_{se}c_s$ , by charge conservation.  Since the electrons are still in a repulsive potential,$Γ^e_{se}$ is just the one way particle flux in a Maxwellian distribution. Therefore we have 
                    $$
                        n^i_{se}\sqrt{\frac{k_bT_e\gamma k_bT_i}{m_i}} = \frac{1}{4}n_{se}^e(\frac{8k_bT_e}{\pi m_e})^{-0.5}exp(\frac{e\Delta\phi}{k_BT_e})
                    $$
                    Assume quasi neutral pre-sheath solve above equation for $\Delta \phi$ then substitute into BRAY 2.51 (floating condition). The resulting equation may be resolved numerically or in terms of the Lambert W function, by re-arragning it.Since the only fundamental difference between MOML and OML is the inclusion of potential barriers in the former, it would be expected that the MOML floating potential would be lower than the OML value for low temperatures, gradually converging to the OML value the ion temperature rise and θ heads towards and beyond unity. In the small grain limit,  MOML is expected to converge to OML since on scales $A≪ 1$ there is no sheath and so no potential barriers to ion collection, the original OML situation.
