                    <h3>DRAFT/COPIED - Shifted Orbital Limited Motion - SOML</h3>
                    Now we consider a more general dusty plasma situation in which the ions have some finite streaming speed. 
                    For such a situation the electron current is as before, but the ion current will be different and can be 
                    calculated by using the ion distribution function. A pain to solve the maths is more complex, but same process,
                    need error function. Problems: The first is the problem shared from its parent theory OML that it fails to
                    take into account the potential barriers arising from the formation of a sheath for the situation $Aâ‰« 1$. 
                    In addition SOML is fundamentally invalid from a theoretical perspective as strictly speaking the presence
                    of a drifting Maxwellian distribution invalids the OML approach owing to the breaking of spherical symmetry
                    and subsequently  conservation  of  angular  momentum.   Recall  it  is  precisely  conservation  of 
                    angular  momentum  which  OML  uses  to  place  a  limit  on  the  ion  current  onto  the  grain....
